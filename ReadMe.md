# Web Design Final Project: McDonald's Website Clone


# Raksa Notes: 22/11/2024

- **Navbar and Footer**  
  - I’ve already made the navbar and footer, and they’re applied to all pages.  
  - For your page, just focus on the main content — no need to worry about the navbar or footer.  

- **Page Layout**  
  - The max width for all content on the desktop version is **1170px**. 
  - The Width that the website is going to the mobile version is **1024px**. 
  - Center your page content and use `max-width: 1170px` to keep everything consistent.  

- **Colors**  
  - I’ve set up most of the colors as CSS variables. To use them, just write:  
    `color: var(--yellow); /* This matches McDonald's yellow perfectly */`  

- **Images**  
  - Create an `images` folder inside your page folder.  
  - You can copy images straight from the McDonald’s website and save them with names you prefer.  

- **Working Process**  
  - Git is optional!  
  - If you’re not using Git, just work in your own folder and send your finished files to the Telegram group. I’ll handle merging everything together.  

- **Extras (if we finish early)**  
  - We can start working on the footer links or clean things up a bit more.
